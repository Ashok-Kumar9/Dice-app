# Dice App ðŸŽ²

## Goal

The objective is to learn core programming concepts that will form the foundation of most of the apps and add functionality to our app using setState() inside Stateful Flutter widgets.


## What we will create

A dice app which could be used to play dice at home if we lost the physical dice or could be used to assign random number to a person for some game.
